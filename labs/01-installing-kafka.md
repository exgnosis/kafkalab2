# Lab 1 : Install Kafka

### Overview

Install and run Kafka

### Depends On

None

### Run time

20 mins

## Options for Installing Kafka

### Option 1:  Native install

This guide walks you through installing Kafka **natively** on your machine.  It assumes you have a 'unix like' system (Linux / Mac / Windows with Linux subsystem).

### Option 2: Docker

Another option is to run our docker image.  This image has all the software (Kafka, Spark ..etc) pre-installed and configured.

This assumes that you can run Docker containers on your machine and you have some basic knowledge of Docker.

Lot of people prefer this, as it has pretty much every thing you need to run the labs with no effort installing and configuring components.

Follow the [docker training image documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/elephantscale/es-training) for details and instructions.
